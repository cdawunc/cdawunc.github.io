      <p>My own conviction constantly deepens that the next great creative chapter in the history of the nation is to be written here in the South… Somewhere in the South there must inevitably grow up an institution… which typifies and serves and guides this new civilization… My dream for the University of North Carolina is that she be nothing less than this.</p>
